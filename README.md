# Assigment

## Preview

## Tech Stack
My tech stack for this project:
* React / ReactCLI
* Redux
* Firebase Backend (Create/Read/Update/Delete)
* HTML
* SCSS
* javascript / RegularExpressions

## Assignment walkthrough
* 2 there is 2 tabs Phonebook/Phonebook Admin
* I wanted to implement Authentication, the idea is that only after being authenticated, the user will be able to update/add/delete phonebook entries otherwise the link is unavailable.
* There is still space for improvement namely more navigation buttons between pages
* I would also like to redirect a user back to the Phonebook page after successfully adding a new contact person.
* Join contact number and email address as one input and let user select email/contact via dropdown
* Input Validation
* In edit mode, you should be able to add/remove contacts and emails too (share same code as Add Person)
* More optimized code (edit contact / add contact could possibly be merged to the same codebase)

## Assignment Requirements
Implement a web application where a user can manage an address book

* A user must be able to see a list of their contacts
* A user must be able to search their contacts
* A user must be able to create a new contact
* A user must be able to update an existing contact
* A user must be able to delete a contact
* A contact consists of a first name and a last name
* A contact can have unlimited contact numbers and email addresses

## Technologies

* Use any database/datastore
* Use any backend technology/framework that is appropriate for the position you are applying for
* Use any UI technology/framework that is appropriate for the position you are applying for

## Assumptions

* Login/logout is not required

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
